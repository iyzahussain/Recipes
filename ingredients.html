    <img src= “veggie" pizza.jpg” width=“300” Height= “300">
    <h3 class = "ingredientstwo">Ingredients </h3>
    <h4>Serves:1, Costs:73p  </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>225g self-raising flour (7p)</li>
            <li>45ml cooking oil (5p)</li>
            <li>90ml warm water (free)</li>
            <li>A sprinkle of salt (1p)</li>
            <li>Tomato puree (20p)</li>
            <li>Grated cheese (40p)</li>
         <h3 class = "methodtwo"> Method </h3>
         <p>Preheat the oven to 180°C (gas mark 4) <br>
         Place the flour and salt into a mixing bowl. <br>
         Slowly mix in the olive oil and warm water to form a dough ball (if it's too sticky, add more flour; if it's too dry, add more water).<br>
         Sprinkle flour onto the rolling pin and the kitchen surface you'll be rolling the dough on, so the dough doesn't stick. <br>
         Roll out the dough ball to form a pizza base. Place the pizza base on a baking tray and bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes.<br>
         Remove the base, cover with tomato puree and top with cheese, then load up your toppings. Cook in the oven for a further 10–15 minutes</p>
          </ul>
